The given node is an Actor with profile:
{'nodetype': 'Actors', 'age': '18-35', 'gender': 'Female', 'marrige': 'No', 'withkids': 'No', 'student': 'Yes', 'workstatue': 'Freelancer', 'residentinneighbor': 'No', 'educationlevel': 'Undergraduate'}

The context of options a similar node connected in the past:
{""option_0:{'nodetype': 'Media Content', 'eventtopic': 'Culture And Arts'}"", ""option_1:{'nodetype': 'Actors', 'age': '18-35', 'gender': 'Male', 'marrige': 'No', 'withkids': 'No', 'student': 'No', 'workstatue': 'Employed', 'residentinneighbor': 'No', 'educationlevel': 'Graduate'}"", ""option_2:{'nodetype': 'Actors', 'age': '18-35', 'gender': 'Male', 'marrige': 'No', 'withkids': 'No', 'student': 'No', 'workstatue': 'Freelancer', 'residentinneighbor': 'No', 'educationlevel': 'Undergraduate'}"", ""option_3:{'nodetype': 'Organization', 'eventtopic': 'Culture And Arts'}"", ""option_4:{'nodetype': 'Media Content', 'eventtopic': 'Community And Organization'}""}

The new options are:
 [{'nodetype': 'Actors', 'age': '18-35', 'gender': 'Male', 'marrige': 'No', 'withkids': 'No', 'student': 'No', 'workstatue': 'Freelancer', 'residentinneighbor': 'No', 'educationlevel': 'Undergraduate'}, {'nodetype': 'Actors', 'age': '18-35', 'gender': 'Male', 'marrige': 'No', 'withkids': 'No', 'student': 'No', 'workstatue': 'Employed', 'residentinneighbor': 'No', 'educationlevel': 'Graduate'}]

Based on the given context and options, here's my analysis:

* option_1: The given node (Actor) has a similar profile to this option (also an Actor), but with different education level. This could lead to a passive connection.
	+ Reason: Similarity in nodetype and demographics
* option_2: The given node (Actor) has a similar profile to this option (also an Actor), with the same education level. This could lead to an active connection.
	+ Reason: Exact match in nodetype, demographics, and education level
* option_3: The given node (Actor) does not have a direct relation with this option (Organization). However, both are related to 'Culture And Arts', which might create a passive connection.
	+ Reason: Shared eventtopic

So, the answer is:
```json
{
  ""answer"": [""Active"",""Passive""],
  ""reasons"": {
    ""option_2"": ""Exact match in nodetype, demographics, and education level"",
    ""option_1"": ""Similarity in nodetype and demographics""
  }
}
```
Note that option_3 is not included in the answer as it does not create a direct connection with the given node."
