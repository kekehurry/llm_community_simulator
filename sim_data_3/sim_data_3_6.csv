```json
{
    ""answer"": [""No"", ""Active""],
    ""reasons"": {
        ""0"": ""The new option has the same node type as the similar node connected in the past (Actors), but different attributes. This suggests an active connection between the two nodes."",
        ""1"": ""There is no clear connection between the given node and this option, based on their respective profiles and previous connections.""
    }
}
```

The reasoning behind my answer is:

* For `option_0`: The new option has a similar node type (Actors) as the similar node connected in the past. However, their attributes differ significantly, indicating that there may not be a direct connection between them.
* For `option_1`: This option shows a high degree of similarity with the given node, sharing the same node type (Actors), age range, gender, and work status. Given this strong similarity, it is likely that the given node would establish an active connection with this option.

Note: The ""No"" choice for `option_1` indicates that there may not be a direct connection between the two nodes based on their attributes alone. However, this does not rule out the possibility of a connection being established through other means or in the future."
