```json
{
  ""answer"": [""No"", ""Active"", ""Passive""],
  ""reasons"": {
    ""option_0"": ""The node has similar characteristics (age and education level) but different gender and work status. It is possible for a passive connection."",
    ""option_1"": ""The node has the same age, gender, and education level as the given node. However, it differs in work status and marital status. An active connection seems less likely."",
    ""option_2"": ""This option has similar characteristics (age and education level) to the given node, but different gender and work status. A passive connection is possible.""
  }
}
```

Here's a breakdown of my reasoning for each option:

1. **Option 0**: The node has similar characteristics (age and education level) to the given node, but differs in gender and work status. This makes it more likely for a passive connection.
2. **Option 1**: Although the node shares some similarities with the given node (same age, gender, and education level), it differs in work status and marital status. An active connection seems less likely due to these differences.
3. **Option 2**: Similar to Option 0, this option has similar characteristics (age and education level) to the given node, making a passive connection possible.

Note that my answer is not definitive and might change based on further context or analysis."
