{
  ""answer"": [""No"", ""Active"", ""Passive""],
  ""reasons"": {
    ""option_2"": ""The given node has a profile related to 'Community And Organization', which is similar to the topic 'Technology And Education'. Therefore, it's possible for an active connection."",

    ""option_5"": ""Similar to option 4, this option also has the same eventtopic, allowing for a passive connection.""
  }
}
```

The reasons behind each choice are:

* **No**: Options like `840` and `697` have no similarity with the given node's profile. Therefore, it's unlikely for any connection.
* **Active**: Option `234` has a topic 'Community And Organization' which is similar to the given node's profile. This allows for an active connection between the two nodes.
* **Passive**: Options like `522`, `720`, `535`, and `540` have different topics than the given node's profile, but they are still connected in the past. Therefore, it's likely for a passive connection to occur.

Note that these evaluations are based on the given context and options, and may not be exhaustive or definitive."
