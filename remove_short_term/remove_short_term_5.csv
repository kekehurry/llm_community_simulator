{
  ""answer"": [""No"",""Active"",""Passive""],
  ""reasons"": {
    ""0"": ""The eventtopic 'Environment And Sustainability' is a good match with the Actor's 'educationlevel' and 'workstatue'."",
    ""1"": ""The actor's profile matches option 6 in the context, so it's likely to be active."",
    ""2"": ""The actor's profile does not match any previous connections for this option, but 'Culture And Arts' is a common interest among similar actors.""
  }
}
```

Explanation:

* For `option_0`: The event topic 'Environment And Sustainability' is a good match with the Actor's 'educationlevel' (Graduate) and 'workstatue' (Employed). This makes it an active option.
* For `option_1`: The actor's profile matches option 6 in the context, so it's likely to be active.
* For `option_2`: The actor's profile does not match any previous connections for this option. However, 'Culture And Arts' is a common interest among similar actors, making it a passive option.
