**Option 1: {'age': '35-55', 'gender': 'Female', 'marrige': 'No', 'withkids': 'No', 'student': 'No', 'workstatue': 'Employed', 'residentinneighbor': 'No', 'educationlevel': 'Graduate'}**

* Age and education level are slightly different from the given node, but employment status is similar. **Active** (reason: ""Similar employment status, but slightly different age and education level"")

**Option 2: {'age': '35-55', 'gender': 'Male', 'marrige': 'No', 'withkids': 'No', 'student': 'No', 'workstatue': 'Employed', 'residentinneighbor': 'No', 'educationlevel': 'Graduate'}**
