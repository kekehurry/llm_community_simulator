The given node is an Actor with profile:
{'age': '18-35', 'gender': 'Male', 'marrige': 'Yes', 'withkids': 'No', 'student': 'Yes', 'workstatue': 'Self-employed', 'residentinneighbor': 'Yes', 'educationlevel': 'Graduate'}

And the context of options a similar node connected in the past:
{""option_1:{'age': '18-35', 'gender': 'Female', 'marrige': 'No', 'withkids': 'No', 'student': 'Yes', 'workstatue': 'Freelancer', 'residentinneighbor': 'No', 'educationlevel': 'Undergraduate'}"", ""option_3:{'age': '35-55', 'gender': 'Male', 'marrige': 'No', 'withkids': 'No', 'student': 'No', 'workstatue': 'Freelancer', 'residentinneighbor': 'No', 'educationlevel': 'Undergraduate'}"", ""option_2:{'age': '35-55', 'gender': 'Male', 'marrige': 'No', 'withkids': 'No', 'student': 'No', 'workstatue': 'Employed', 'residentinneighbor': 'No', 'educationlevel': 'Graduate'}"", ""option_0:{'eventtopic': 'Culture And Arts'}""}

The new options are:
[{'age': '35-55', 'gender': 'Male', 'marrige': 'No', 'withkids': 'No', 'student': 'No', 'workstatue': 'Employed', 'residentinneighbor': 'No', 'educationlevel': 'Graduate'}, {'age': '18-35', 'gender': 'Female', 'marrige': 'No', 'withkids': 'No', 'student': 'No', 'workstatue': 'Freelancer', 'residentinneighbor': 'No', 'educationlevel': 'Undergraduate'}, {'age': '35-55', 'gender': 'Male', 'marrige': 'No', 'withkids': 'No', 'student': 'No', 'workstatue': 'Freelancer', 'residentinneighbor': 'No', 'educationlevel': 'Undergraduate'}, {'eventtopic': 'Culture And Arts'}]

    ""option_1"": ""The given node is a male in the age range of 18-35, and option 1 has a female in the same age range. Although they have different genders, their other attributes are similar."",
    ""option_2"": ""The given node has a higher education level than option 2. However, option 2 has an employed workstatue, which might be attractive to the given node's self-employed status.""
  }
}
```

In this evaluation, I chose 'Active' for option 1 because the gender difference is not too significant, and their other attributes are similar. I chose 'Passive' for option 2 because while there are some differences in education level and workstatue, they might still be connected due to the attractive employed workstatue of option 2.

Note that I did not choose any of the other options as 'Active' or 'Passive' because they do not seem to have a strong connection with the given node."
