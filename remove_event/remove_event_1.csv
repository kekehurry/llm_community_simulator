In the above output, I chose ""Active"" for `option_0` because the given node and the corresponding new option share similar demographic attributes. For `option_4`, I selected ""Passive"" since both nodes are associated with the topic 'Technology And Education', which could facilitate a passive connection.

Here is how you can achieve this:

1. Define a dictionary to store the reasons for each choice.
2. Iterate over the new options and compare them with the given node's attributes using a dictionary comprehension or a loop.
3. For each option, check if there are any matching attributes between the given node and the current new option.
4. If a match is found, add ""Active"" to the answer list along with the reason in the reasons dictionary.
5. If no exact match is found but the topic of an event or media content matches, consider it as a potential passive connection and add ""Passive"" to the answer list along with the reason.
6. Make sure the total number of 'non-No' options (i.e., 'Active', 'Passive') does not exceed 10.

Note that this is just one possible approach based on the given data, and you might need to modify it according to your specific requirements or additional data."
